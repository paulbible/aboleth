# aboleth

A small project combining Clojure with OpenCV

# Getting Started

Follow [OpenCV with for Clojure][opencv] to get started.

Install OpenCV by downloading [cmake][cmake]. Make sure you have [ant][ant] installed.

I think both static and dynamic libraries are needed. You will end up with two jars:

opencv-300.jar and libopencv_java300.dylib

Install [localrepo][lrepo] and include opencv-300.jar
